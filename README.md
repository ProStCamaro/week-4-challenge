# JavaScript Quiz

This project is a quiz about JavaScript terminology. This was meant for others like me who want a quick refresher on what some of the JavaScript terms are.

# Usage

The way this project works is that as soon as you open the webpage a timer for 60 seconds starts. During that time you have to answer 6 questions. Unfortunately the quiz does not stop after the timer stops, so it's more of a personal challenge for the user.
